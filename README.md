Python program using its visualization code library to link the (w, z) output array from a y\bar{y}\ matrix spreadsheet and create three-dimensional (3D) beam propagation models, assuming radial symmetry. The program simulates the beam intensity distribution by altering the color of the beam depending on its radius profile as the rays traversed the optical system.
